<p>1. Brawl Pass (Free Track)<br />The free track of the Brawl Pass occasionally gives small amounts of gems (around 10 per tier).<br />You need to progress by playing and completing quests.<br />2. Special Events &amp; Challenges<br />Sometimes Supercell runs special events or challenges that reward gems.<br />Keep an eye on announcements in the game or social media.<br />3. Trophy Road (Old Accounts)<br />If you have an older account, you may still get some gems from Trophy Road at certain milestones.<br />Newer accounts don&rsquo;t get this benefit.<br />4. Daily Free Offers (Rare)<br />Sometimes, Supercell randomly gives out gems in the shop as a free offer.<br />5. Giveaways &amp; Creator Codes<br />Brawl Stars content creators often host giveaways for gems.<br />You can also support creators with their creator codes, which can sometimes unlock special rewards in promotions.<br />6. Google Play / Apple Rewards<br />Participate in Google Opinion Rewards or Apple&rsquo;s equivalent to earn credits, which you can use to buy gems.<br />ðŸš¨ Avoid scams! Any site claiming to give free gems outside the game is fake. Supercell doesn&rsquo;t offer gem generators or hacks.</p>
